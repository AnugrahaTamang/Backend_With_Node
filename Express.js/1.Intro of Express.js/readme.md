# Framework

--> Web framework are sets of pre-written code and libraries that provide a foundation for developing software applications.

# Pre-written code and library

1. Tools

3. Modules Example: database component, caching, pagination, session management, form handling , security mechanism, user authentication, APIs, payment gateways.

# Type of framework

# 1. Opinionated framework

- No strict rules of predefined workflow.

1. Express.js(Node.js)
2. Flask(python )
3. fastAPI(python)
4. Koa.js (Node.js)

# Benefits of framework

- Code organization
- Reusability
- standardization
- Testing and debugging support
- Community and support

# Express.js

--> Express.js is a fast, minimal and flexible web framework for Node.js that simplifies building web applications and APIs in a more structured and organized way.
